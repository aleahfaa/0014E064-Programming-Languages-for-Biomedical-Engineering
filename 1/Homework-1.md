# Number 1
Assume a floating-point variable `f` has a value of 2.936 and an integer variable `i` has a value of 5. Write a program to multiply `(f * i)` and divide `(f / i)` these two variables and print the results.
# Number 2
Write a program that allows the user to input an integer `num` and outputs `(-num)`.
# Number 3
Write a program that allows the user to input a floating-point number `f` and outputs `f^2`. For example f = 5, so the result (f^2) is 25.
# Number 4
Write a program that allows the user to input two integers `a`and `b`, and outputs `b - a`.
